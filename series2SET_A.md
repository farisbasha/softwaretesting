## 1.Define Prime Path Coverage?
- Prime Path Coverage is a testing approach where all unique paths through a program's control flow graph, called prime paths, are tested at least once. It ensures comprehensive testing by covering every statement in the program exactly once.

- According to prime path coverage(PPC), each prime path must be covered in test requirements.
- **! (Exclamation Mark)**: Marks the final node or endpoint of a path.
  
- **\* (Asterisk)**: Denotes a loop or cycle in the path.
