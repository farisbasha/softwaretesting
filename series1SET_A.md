# **Part A**

## **1.Explain the differences between Validation and Verification?**


| Aspect        | Validation                               | Verification                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Definition    | Ensures the software meets requirements  | Confirms that the software meets standards |
| Focus         | Addresses user needs and expectations    | Emphasizes technical specifications         |
| Timing        | Done at the end of the development cycle| Performed throughout the development cycle |
| Method        | Involves testing actual software         | Involves reviewing documents and code      |
| Outcome       | Assures the right product is built      | Assures the product is built right         |


## **2.Define Ground string, Mutation score, and Mutants?**


| Term          | Definition                                                                                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ground string | Test cases used to measure the performance of mutation testing tools.                                              |
| Mutation score| A percentage showing how many modified code versions (mutants) are caught by the test suite.                      |
| Mutants       | Modified versions of code designed to simulate errors, used to assess test suite effectiveness.                   |


## **3.Define Node coverage, Edge coverage and Prime path coverage in a control flow graph?**
